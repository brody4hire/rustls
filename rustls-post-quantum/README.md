# rustls-post-quantum

<!-- TODO(portable-rustls) CLEANUP & IMPROVE NOTE FOR THIS FORK -->
NOTE: THIS SEPARATE "`rustls-post-quantum`" CRATE WHICH ONLY CONTAINS ALIASES IS ONLY KEPT IN THIS FORK FOR CI TESTING PURPOSES. SEE INFO BELOW FOR HOW TO USE THIS "`rustls-post-quantum`" FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE CORE `portable-rustls` CRATE IN THIS FORK.

The functionality of this crate became part of the core rustls
crate from the 0.23.22 release. When using that version of the crate,
use the `prefer-post-quantum` Cargo feature to control whether to prefer
using post-quantum algorithms instead of using this crate.

This crate is release under the same licenses as the [main rustls crate][rustls].
